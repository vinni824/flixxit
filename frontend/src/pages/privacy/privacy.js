          Privacy Statement explains how we collect, use, and disclose your
          personal information when you use the "Flixxit service" to access
          "Flixxit content" as those terms are defined in the Flixxit Terms of
          Use (flixxit.com/terms). It also explains what privacy rights you have
          and how to exercise them. Certain functionalities or apps that are
          part of the Flixxit service may also provide you with contextual
          privacy information or choices, in addition to the information and
          choices described in this Privacy Statement. Please note that this
          Privacy Statement may be easier to navigate when viewed on your web
          browser. ### Contacting Us For questions about this Privacy Statement,
          our use of your personal information, or how to exercise your privacy
          rights, please contact our Data Protection Officer/Privacy Office at

          entities) that are responsible for your personal information (known as
          the “data controller” in certain countries) is available at
          flixxit.com/legal/corpinfo. ### Section A: Our Collection, Use, and
          Disclosure of Personal Information #### The Categories of Personal
          Information We Collect We collect the following categories of personal

          a password). Depending on how you subsequently set up your account and
          method of payment, and which features you use, we also collect one or
          more of the following: first and last name, phone number, postal
          address, and other identifiers you provide to us. If you subscribe to
          an ad-supported subscription plan, we also collect gender and date of

          other information to process your payments, including your payment
          history, billing address, and gift cards you have redeemed. 3.

          subscribe to an ad-supported subscription plan, we collect information
          about the ads on Flixxit (“Advertisements,” as defined in the Flixxit
          Terms of Use) that you view or interact with, device information (such
          as resettable device identifiers), IP addresses, and information
          provided by Advertising Companies (such as information about your
          likely interests they have collected or inferred from your visits to
          other websites and apps). We use this information to display
          Advertisements to you in the Flixxit service (including behavioral
          advertisements in accordance with your preferences). 6. **Device and

          other streaming media devices), your network, and network devices. The
          information includes: - device IDs or other unique identifiers,
          including for your network devices (such as your router), and devices
          that are Flixxit-capable on your network; - IP addresses (which can be
          used to tell us the general location of your device, such as your
          city, state/province, and postal code); - device and software
          characteristics (such as type and configuration), referring source
          (for example, referrer URLs), standard web browser and mobile app log

          and debug log messages; and - cookie data, resettable device
          identifiers, advertising identifiers, and other unique identifiers
          (described below in the section “Cookies and Internet Advertising”).

          contacting customer support via online chat or voice call), engage in
          our surveys or feedback requests (such as when you cancel), we collect
          the contents of such communications. We also collect details of
          communications that we send you (such as via email, push
          notifications, text message, or within the Flixxit service), and
          information about your interaction and engagement with these
          communications. --- This updated version now uses "Flixxit" throughout
          the Privacy Statement. Let me know if you'd like further changes or
          clarifications!
