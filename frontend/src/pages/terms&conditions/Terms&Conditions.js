          Flixxit provides a personalized subscription service that allows our
          members to access entertainment content (“Flixxit content”) over the
          Internet on certain Internet-connected TVs, computers, and other
          devices ("Flixxit-ready devices"). These Terms of Use govern your use
          of our service. As used in these Terms of Use, "Flixxit service", "our
          service" or "the service" means the personalized service provided by
          Flixxit for discovering and accessing Flixxit content, including all
          features and functionalities, recommendations and reviews, our
          websites, and user interfaces, as well as all content and software
          associated with our service. References to ‘you’ in these Terms of Use
          indicate the member who created the Flixxit account and whose payment
          method is charged. ### Membership 1.1. Your Flixxit membership will
          continue until terminated. To use the Flixxit service, you must have
          Internet access and a Flixxit-ready device, and provide us with one or
          more Payment Methods. “Payment Method” means a current, valid,
          accepted method of payment, as may be updated from time to time, and
          which may include payment through your account with a third party.
          Unless you cancel your membership before your billing date, you
          authorize us to charge the subscription fee for the next billing cycle
          to your Payment Method (see "Cancellation" below). 1.2. We may offer a
          number of subscription plans, including subscriptions offered by third
          parties in conjunction with the provision of their own products and
          services. We are not responsible for the products and services
          provided by such third parties. Some subscription plans may have
          differing conditions and limitations, which will be disclosed at your
          sign-up or in other communications made available to you. You can find
          specific details regarding your Flixxit subscription by visiting the
          flixxit.com website and clicking on the "Account" link available at
          the top of the pages under your profile name. ### Promotional Offers
          We may from time to time offer special promotional offers, plans or
          memberships (“Offers”). Offer eligibility is determined by Flixxit at
          its sole discretion and we reserve the right to revoke an Offer and
          put your account on hold in the event that we determine you are not
          eligible. Members of households with an existing or recent Flixxit
          membership may not be eligible for certain introductory Offers. We may
          use information such as device ID, method of payment or an account
          email address used with an existing or recent Flixxit membership to
          determine Offer eligibility. The eligibility requirements and other
          limitations and conditions will be disclosed when you sign-up for the
          Offer or in other communications made available to you. ### Billing
          and Cancellation 3.1. **Billing Cycle**: The subscription fee for the
          Flixxit service and any other charges you may incur in connection with
          your use of the service, such as taxes and possible transaction fees,
          will be charged to your Payment Method on the specific payment date
          indicated on the "Account" page. The length of your billing cycle will
          depend on the type of subscription plan that you choose when you
          signed up for the service. In some cases your payment date may change,
          for example if your Payment Method has not successfully settled, when
          you change your subscription plan or if your paid subscription began
          on a day not contained in a given month. Visit the flixxit.com website
          and click on the "Billing details" link on the "Account" page to see
          your next payment date. We may authorize your Payment Method in
          anticipation of subscription or service-related charges through
          various methods, including authorizing it for up to approximately one
          month of service as soon as you register. If you signed up for Flixxit
          using your account with a third party as a Payment Method, you can
          find the billing information about your Flixxit subscription by
          visiting your account with the applicable third party. 3.2. **Payment
          Methods**: To use the Flixxit service, you must provide one or more
          Payment Methods. You authorize us to charge any Payment Method
          associated to your account in case your primary Payment Method is
          declined or no longer available to us for payment of your subscription
          fee. You remain responsible for any uncollected amounts. If a payment
          is not successfully settled, due to expiration, insufficient funds, or
          otherwise, and you do not cancel your account, we may suspend your
          access to the service until we have successfully charged a valid
          Payment Method. For some Payment Methods, the issuer may charge you
          certain fees, such as foreign transaction fees or other fees relating
          to the processing of your Payment Method. Local tax charges may vary
          depending on the Payment Method used. Check with your Payment Method
          service provider for details. 3.3. **Updating your Payment Methods**:
          You can update your Payment Methods by going to the "Account" page. We
          may also update your Payment Methods using information provided by the
          payment service providers. Following any update, you authorize us to
          continue to charge the applicable Payment Method(s). 3.4.
          **Cancellation**: You can cancel your Flixxit membership at any time,
          and you will continue to have access to the Flixxit service through
          the end of your billing period. To the extent permitted by the
          applicable law, payments are non-refundable and we do not provide
          refunds or credits for any partial membership periods or unused
          Flixxit content. To cancel, go to the "Account" page and follow the
          instructions for cancellation. If you cancel your membership, your
          account will automatically close at the end of your current billing
          period. To see when your account will close, click "Billing details"
          on the "Account" page. If you signed up for Flixxit using your account
          with a third party as a Payment Method and wish to cancel your Flixxit
          membership, you may need to do so through such third party, for
          example by visiting your account with the applicable third party and
          turning off auto-renew, or unsubscribing from the Flixxit service
          through that third party. 3.5. **Changes to the Price and Subscription
          Plans**: We may change our subscription plans and the price of our
          service from time to time. We will notify you at least one month
          before any price changes or changes to your subscription plan will
          become effective. ### Flixxit Service 4.1. You must be at least 18
          years of age to become a member of the Flixxit service. Minors may
          only use the service under the supervision of an adult. 4.2. The
          Flixxit service and any content accessed through the service are for
          your personal and non-commercial use only and may not be shared with
          individuals beyond your household unless otherwise allowed by your
          subscription plan. During your Flixxit membership, we grant you a
          limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable right to access the Flixxit
          service and Flixxit content. Except for the foregoing, no right, title
          or interest shall be transferred to you. You agree not to use the
          service for public performances. 4.3. You may access the Flixxit
          content primarily within the country in which you have established
          your account and only in geographic locations where we offer our
          service and have licensed such content. For the purpose of determining
          the taxes that will be charged over your subscription fee, we will use
          the IP address that is used when you sign up to the Flixxit service.
          The content that may be available will vary by geographic location and
          will change from time to time. The number of devices on which you may
          simultaneously watch depends on your chosen subscription plan and is
          specified on the "Account" page. 4.4. The Flixxit service, including
          the content library, is regularly updated and we may give you the
          opportunity to watch live or special events (including replays of such
          content) or to enjoy new additional features. Such content and new
          features may contain commercial breaks and other types of commercial
          messages. Flixxit does not endorse or sponsor any advertised products
          or services and any interactions with advertisers, including through
          engagement with interactive advertisements, are at your own option and
          risk. In addition, we continually test various aspects of our service,
          including our websites, user interfaces, and promotional features. You
          can turn off test participation at any time by visiting the "Account"
          page and changing the "Test participation" settings. 4.5. Some Flixxit
          content is available for temporary download and offline viewing on
          certain supported devices (“Offline Titles”). Limitations apply,
          including restrictions on the number of Offline Titles per account,
          the maximum number of devices that can contain Offline Titles, the
          time period within which you will need to begin viewing Offline
          Titles, and how long the Offline Titles will remain accessible. Some
          Offline Titles may not be playable in certain countries and if you go
          online in a country where you would not be able to stream that Offline
          Title, the Offline Title will not be playable while you are in that
          country. 4.6. You agree to use the Flixxit service, including all
          features and functionalities associated therewith, in accordance with
          all applicable laws, rules and regulations, or other restrictions on
          use of the service or content therein. Except as explicitly authorized
          by us, you agree not to: (i) archive, reproduce, distribute, modify,
          display, perform, publish, license, create derivative works from,
          offer for sale, or use content and information contained on or
          obtained from or through the Flixxit service; (ii) circumvent, remove,
          alter, deactivate, degrade, block, obscure or thwart any of the
          content protections or other elements of the Flixxit service,
          including the graphical user interface, copyright notices, and
          trademarks; (iii) use any robot, spider, scraper, or other automated
          means to access the Flixxit service; (iv) decompile, reverse engineer
          or disassemble any software or other products or processes accessible
          through the Flixxit service; (v) insert any code or product or
          manipulate the content of the Flixxit service in any way; (vi) use any
          data mining, data gathering, or extraction method; (vii) upload, post,
          e-mail or otherwise send or transmit any material designed to
          interrupt, destroy, or limit the functionality of any computer
          software or hardware or telecommunications equipment associated with
          the Flixxit service, including any software viruses or any other
          computer code, files or programs. We may terminate or restrict your
          use of our service if you violate these Terms of Use or are engaged in
          illegal or fraudulent use of the service. 4.7. The quality of the
          display of the Flixxit content may vary from device to device, and may
          be affected by a variety of factors, such as your location, the
          bandwidth available through and/or speed of your Internet connection.
          HD, Ultra HD, and HDR availability is subject to your Internet service
          and device capabilities. Not all content is available in all formats,
          such as HD, Ultra HD, or HDR, and not all subscription plans allow you
          to receive content in all formats. The minimum connection speed for HD
          video quality (defined as a resolution of 720p or higher) is 3.0 Mbps
          per stream; however, we recommend a faster connection for improved
          video quality. A connection speed of at least 5.0 Mbps per stream is
          recommended to receive Full HD video quality (defined as a resolution
          of 1080p or higher). A connection speed of at least 15.0 Mbps per
          stream is recommended to receive Ultra HD video quality (defined as a
          resolution of 4K or higher). You are responsible for all Internet
          access charges. Please check with your Internet provider for
          information on possible Internet data usage charges. The time it takes
          to begin watching Flixxit content will vary based on a number of
          factors, including your location, available bandwidth at the time, the
          content you have selected, and the configuration of your Flixxit-ready
          device. 4.8. Flixxit software is developed by, or for, Flixxit and may
          solely be used for authorized streaming and to access Flixxit content
          through Flixxit-ready devices. This software may vary by device and
          medium, and functionalities and features may also differ between
          devices. You acknowledge that the use of the service may require
          third-party software that is subject to third-party licenses. You
          agree that you may automatically receive updated versions of the
          Flixxit software and related third-party software. ### Passwords and
          Account Access You are responsible for any activity that occurs
          through the Flixxit account. By allowing others to access the account
          (which includes access to information on viewing activity for the
          account), you agree that such individuals are acting on your behalf
          and that you are bound by any changes that they may make to the
          account, including but not limited to changes to the subscription
          plan. To help maintain control over the account and to prevent any
          unauthorized users from accessing the account, you should maintain
          control over the devices that are used to access the service and not
          reveal the password or details of the Payment Method associated with
          the account to anyone. You agree to provide and maintain accurate
          information relating to your account, including a valid email address
          so we can send you account-related notices. We can terminate your
          account or place your account on hold in order to protect you,
          Flixxit, or our partners from identity theft or other fraudulent
          activity. ### Warranties and Limitations on Liability The Flixxit
          service is provided "as is" and without warranty or condition. In
          particular, our service may not be uninterrupted or error-free. You
          waive all special, indirect, and consequential damages against us.
          These terms will not limit any non-waivable warranties or mandatory
          consumer protection rights that apply to you. ### Class Action Waiver
          WHERE PERMITTED UNDER THE APPLICABLE LAW, YOU AND FLIXXIT AGREE THAT
          EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL
          CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED
          CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, where permitted under the
          applicable law, unless both you and Flixxit agree otherwise, the court
          may not consolidate more than one person's claims with your claims,
          and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or
          class proceeding. --- This modified version now references "Flixxit"
          throughout the Terms of Use. Let me know if you need any further
          adjustments!
